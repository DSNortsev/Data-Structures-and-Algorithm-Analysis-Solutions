# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-Solutions
Solutions for Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ 4th edition by Mark Allen Weiss.

For now, it will contain solutions for selected exercises, the ones that I find either hard or interesting. 
No plans for complete solutions right now, however it might change in future.
For every chapter, there will be a single tex and pdf file that will contain the solutions to theoretical exercises,
and .cpp file for every programming assignment.
I try to stick to modern C++ as much as possible.
